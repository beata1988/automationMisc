# automationMisc
AutomationMisc is a project intended to inorporate an automation framework with playwright and TS.
Expedia pages stop working after several iterations so I used other real pages such as hotels.com and booking.com to simulate the same user stories
However, after running tests so many times, the pages become unresponsive as a result of automation detection in the browsers.
Playwright and TS were the preferred technologies for this as Playwright provides a robust and easier way to interact with web pages

Before running tests
Make sure to install Playwright via Node js with Visual Code.
Screenshots and reports can be seen in the file allure-results
An report of the tests with screenshots can be found in the folder: test results
A playwright report can be found in the folder "playwright-report" by copying the path of the index.html to any browser.

The playwright test cases are located in the folder expedia-->tests
Every User story's test case is documented in the md files
